# 📚 Study Path / Learning Timeline

Here’s a structured learning path that takes you from zero to applying Machine Learning in real projects.

## 1. 🐍 Python Programming (Standalone)

This roadmap is designed to help you get started with Python, from beginner to advanced concepts.  
> 💡 **Note:** This plan covers core topics, but Python has much more to explore based on your goals—whether it's data science, web development, automation, or beyond.

---

## 🔹 Basic Python (Week 1)

*Foundational topics to get started with Python.*

### 1. Environment Setup & Package Management
- ✅ Installing Python and setting up a coding environment
- ✅ Using package managers: `conda`
> 🎯 **Make sure to follow this part using the** [**Python Programming (2023) – Pytopia**](https://www.pytopia.ai/courses/python) **course.**

### 2. Python Basics & Data Structures
- ✅ Python basics: variables, loops, conditionals, functions  
- ✅ Data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples  

> **and...** 


🧠 **After this section, we’ll have a short set of hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding of the basics.**


## 🔹 Intermediate Python (Week 2–3)

*Build reusable, organized, and object-oriented Python code.*

- ✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Classes and objects  
  - Inheritance, encapsulation, and basic polymorphism  

- ✅ **Modular Programming**  
  - Writing reusable code with modules  
  - Using `import`, `from`, and creating custom `.py` modules  
  - Understanding `__main__` and `__init__.py`

> **and...** additional concepts 

🛠️ **By the end of this section, you’ll work on a small project.**  

---

## 🔹 Advanced Python (Optional)

*Learn expressive, powerful Python features for more professional development.*

- ✅ **Generators & Iterators**
  - `yield`, lazy evaluation, custom iterator classes

- ✅ **Decorators**
  - Using `@decorator`, nested functions, and practical use cases (e.g., logging, validation)

- ✅ **Lambda Functions & Functional Programming**
  - `lambda`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`  

- ✅ **Context Managers & the `with` Statement**
  - Writing custom context managers using `__enter__` and `__exit__`  
  - Using the `contextlib` module

> **and...** you can go deeper
